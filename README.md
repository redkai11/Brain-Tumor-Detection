# Brain-Tumor-Detection

# Objective
The main objective of this project is to build a CNN model which detects brain tumor from an MRI image.

# Description
This is a kaggle project.
Dataset can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection or from the uploaded zip file in this repository.

* Transforming/modifying images to expand the size of dataset.
* Build and train a CNN model using augmented images

# Result 

The trainned cnn model had a validation accuracy of 90.48%. With more dataset, I believe the accuracy can be improved.
